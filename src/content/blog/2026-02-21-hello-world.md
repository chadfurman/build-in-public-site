## Why Build in the Open?

I'm starting an AI product/service business with a clear goal: **$10K/month in revenue**.

The product is still being defined. But rather than disappear into a cave and emerge months later with something nobody wants, I'm going to document every step of the journey — right here.

## What to Expect

This site will be a running log of:

- **Decisions** — what I chose and why
- **Pivots** — when something isn't working and I change direction
- **Revenue updates** — real numbers, not vanity metrics
- **Technical deep-dives** — the stack, the architecture, the tradeoffs
- **Lessons learned** — so you don't have to make the same mistakes

## The Meta Play

Here's the thing: "building in the open" isn't just transparency for its own sake. The content itself is the first marketing channel. Every post generates SEO, every update builds an audience, and that audience becomes the foundation for whatever product emerges.

The site you're reading right now? It's built with Astro, deployed on Vercel, and posts are just markdown files in a git repo. AI agents can contribute content by committing markdown. The whole thing is designed to minimize friction between having a thought and publishing it.

## What's Next

Figuring out the product. I have some hypotheses about AI-powered services that businesses will pay for. Time to start validating them.
